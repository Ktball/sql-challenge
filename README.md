 Project 9 Challenge
I completed this homework assignment using the following tools:
1) class activities and zoom recordings from class especially for the ERD 
2) PostgreSQL Sample Database https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/
   provided by our instructor through Slack
3) QuickDatabase Diagrams https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/#/
4) asked questions during office hours
5) ChatGPT (minimal use but did ask a few clarifying questions)

I enjoyed this assignment very much!
